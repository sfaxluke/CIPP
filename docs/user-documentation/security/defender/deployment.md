# Defender Deployment

Run this form to stand Microsoft Defender up in one or more tenants in a single pass. It builds the Intune side of a Defender rollout: the connector settings that link Defender to Intune, an antivirus defaults policy, an exclusion policy, and an Attack Surface Reduction policy, each with its own assignment. Every section is optional, so you can deploy just the parts you need, and you can save what you have configured as reusable Intune templates instead of deploying it.

## Action Buttons

<details>

<summary>Save as Template</summary>

Opens a dialog that saves the settings currently on the form as Intune templates rather than deploying them to a tenant. Each section you configured becomes its own template, so a form with an antivirus policy and an ASR policy produces two.

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Template Name Prefix | Required. Every template produced is named with this prefix followed by the policy it holds, giving names like `Default Defender - AV Policy`. |
| Package (optional) | Groups the templates produced under a package name, so they can be picked up together when building a Standards template. |

{% hint style="info" %}
Saved templates are visible in [list-templates](../../endpoint/mem/list-templates/ "mention").

### Tenant Selection

Select one or more tenants to apply the policies. This is a required field, and at least one tenant must be selected.

### Defender Setup Options

Turn on **Show Defender Setup Options** to configure how Defender connects to Intune for each device platform, and what happens when it cannot be reached.

#### Threat Remediation Actions

Set what Defender does with a detection, separately for **Low severity threats**, **Moderate severity threats**, **High severity threats** and **Severe threats**. All four offer the same choices.

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Clean | Service tries to recover files and try to disinfect. |
| Quarantine | Moves files to quarantine. |
| Remove | Removes files from system. |
| Allow | Allows file, and does none of the above actions. |
| User defined | Requires user to make a decision on which action to take. |
| Block | Blocks file execution. |

#### Policy Assignment

Who the antivirus policy is assigned to: Do Not Assign, Assign to All Users, Assign to All Devices, or Assign to All Users and Devices.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Exclusion Policy

Turn on **Show Exclusion Policy Options** to build a policy that keeps Defender away from specific extensions, paths and processes. Each of the three lists is built entry by entry: select the add button to create a row, type the value, and use the remove icon beside a row to drop it.

| Setting             | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Excluded Extensions | File extensions to exclude from scanning, one per row, for example `txt`, `log` or `tmp`.      |
| Excluded Paths      | File and folder paths to exclude, one per row, for example `C:\temp`.                          |
| Excluded Processes  | Processes to exclude, one per row, for example `notepad.exe`.                                  |
| Assign to Group     | Who the exclusion policy is assigned to: Do Not Assign, Assign to All Users, Assign to All Devices, or Assign to All Users and Devices. |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Exclusions apply to every device the policy is assigned to. Excluding a broad path or a commonly abused process creates a blind spot that malware can be dropped into, so keep the lists as narrow as the application actually requires.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### ASR

Turn on **Show ASR Options** to build an Attack Surface Reduction policy. Pick a **Mode** for the policy, then turn on the rules you want it to carry.

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Mode    | How every rule in the policy behaves: Block mode, Audit mode, or Warn mode. |

{% hint style="info" %}
The mode applies to the whole policy rather than to individual rules. Deploying in **Audit mode** first shows you what each rule would have blocked, which is the safer way to introduce ASR into a tenant you do not know well.
{% endhint %}

| Block Office applications from creating executable content                                        | Prevents Word, Excel and PowerPoint from writing executable files to disk, blocking a common macro malware delivery technique.                                                                                             |
| Block Office applications from injecting code into other processes                                | Prevents Office applications from injecting code into other running processes, which is used by some exploit techniques to execute malicious code under a trusted process.                                                 |
| Block rebooting machine in Safe Mode                                                              | Prevents attackers from rebooting the device into Safe Mode, a technique used by some ransomware families to disable security tools before encrypting files.                                                               |
| Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion | Blocks executable files that are new, rarely seen, or not on a trusted list. Uses cloud intelligence to evaluate file reputation before allowing execution. Can generate false positives for legitimate but rare software. |
| Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content                         | Prevents JavaScript and VBScript files, frequently used as malware droppers, from downloading and executing binaries. Targets drive by download attacks.                                                                   |
| Block Webshell creation for Servers                                                               | Prevents the creation of web shell scripts on servers. Targets post exploitation persistence where attackers drop scripts into web accessible directories to maintain remote access.                                       |
| Block Office communication application from creating child processes                              | Prevents Outlook, Teams and other Office communication apps from spawning child processes.

| Block all Office applications from creating child processes                                       | Blanket block on child process creation from any Office application. Broader than the communication app rule, covering Word, Excel, PowerPoint and others.                                                                 |
| Block untrusted and unsigned processes that run from USB                                          | Prevents execution of untrusted or unsigned binaries from USB and removable devices. Helps mitigate attacks delivered via physical media.                                                                                  |

| Block abuse of exploited vulnerable signed drivers (Device)                                       | Prevents malware from using legitimately signed but vulnerable drivers, sometimes described as bring your own vulnerable driver, to gain kernel level access and disable security software.                                 |
| Assign to Group                                                                                   | Who the ASR policy is assigned to: Do Not Assign, Assign to All Users, Assign to All Devices, or Assign to All Users and Devices.                                                                                          |
