# Edit Safe Links Policy

Opens an existing Safe Links policy and its rule together, so a change to the protection settings and a change to who receives them are made in one place. The form is the same as [add.md](add.md "mention") with the current values loaded in, and one difference: **Policy Name** is fixed and cannot be changed once the policy exists.
