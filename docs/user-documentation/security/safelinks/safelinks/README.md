# Safe Links Policies

Safe Links rewrites and checks links in mail, Teams and Office documents at the moment someone clicks them. In Exchange Online this is really two objects: a policy holding the protection settings, and a rule deciding who the policy applies to. CIPP joins the pair back together so each row is one complete configuration, and flags the cases where the pair has come apart.

### Configuration Status

| Value | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `Complete` | Both a policy and its matching rule exist. This is the healthy state. |
| `Policy Only (Missing Rule)` | The protection settings exist but nothing scopes them to anyone, so the policy is not applying. |
| `Rule Only (Missing Policy)` | A rule points at a policy that does not exist. The named policy is shown in the value. |
| `Built-In Rule Only (No Associated Policy)` | A Microsoft managed Safe Links rule with no separate policy behind it. |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Anything other than `Complete` means the configuration is not doing what its name suggests. A **Policy Only** row is protection nobody is receiving, and a **Rule Only** row is a scope pointing at nothing. Both are worth resolving rather than leaving in place.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Changes to Safe Links policies and rules may take up to 6 hours to propagate throughout your organization.
