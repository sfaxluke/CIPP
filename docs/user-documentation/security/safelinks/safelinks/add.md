# Add Safe Links Policy

Creates a new Safe Links policy and the rule that scopes it, in the tenant you currently have selected. The form builds both objects together, so the configuration lands complete rather than as a policy with nobody attached to it.

## Safe Links Policy Configuration

**Policy Settings**

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Policy Name | Required. Names the policy. It is checked against the tenant's existing policies as you type, and a name already in use is rejected. |
| Description | Free text describing what the policy is for. |
| Enable Safe Links For Email | Protects links in email. |
| Enable Safe Links For Teams | Protects links in Teams. |
| Enable Safe Links For Office | Protects links in Office applications. |
| Track Clicks | Records when users click a protected link. |
| Scan URLs | Scans links in real time when they are clicked. |
| Enable For Internal Senders | Applies the policy to mail sent inside the organisation as well as mail from outside. |
| Allow Click Through | Lets users continue past the warning page to a link flagged as malicious. Leaving this off is the stricter setting. |
| Disable URL Rewrite | Turns off link rewriting, leaving the click time check in place without changing how the link looks. |
| Enable Organization Branding | Puts the organisation's branding on warning pages. |
| Deliver Message After Scan | Holds a message until its links have been scanned. |
| Custom Notification Text | The wording shown to users about the scan. Greyed out until **Deliver Message After Scan** is on. |
| Do Not Rewrite URLs | URLs, domains or wildcard patterns the policy leaves untouched, for example `*.example.com` or `https://example.com`. Entries are validated as you add them and an entry that is not a valid URL, domain or pattern is rejected. |

## Safe Links Rule Configuration

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Rule Name (Auto-generated) | Read only. Filled in for you as the policy name followed by `_Rule`. |
| Priority | The order this rule is evaluated in against other Safe Links rules. Lower numbers are evaluated first, and the value must be 0 or greater. |
| Enable Rule | Whether the configuration is active once created. On by default. |
| Comments | Free text kept against the rule. |
