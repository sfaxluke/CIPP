# Applications

Applications lists the applications available for deployment through Intune for the selected tenant, along with how each one is currently assigned and excluded. From here you can deploy new applications, change assignments, save an application as a reusable template, or remove an application from the tenant. The list covers line-of-business and managed applications, plus any other application that already has an assignment, so it will not show every item in the Intune catalogue.

## Action Buttons

<details>

<summary>Add Application</summary>

Opens the Application Deployment drawer. Pick an application type, select one or more tenants, complete the type-specific fields, then choose how the application should be assigned and select **Deploy Application**. Deployments are queued rather than applied immediately, so progress is tracked on the Application Queue page.

**MSP Vendor App**

Deploys an RMM or security agent installer as a Win32 application. Choose the tool under **Select MSP Tool** and the form then asks only for that vendor's details. Two fields are common to all of them:

| Field                           | Description                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Select MSP Tool                 | The vendor agent to deploy.                           |
| Intune Application Display Name | The name the application will appear under in Intune. |

Site-level fields repeat once for every tenant you selected, labelled with that tenant's name, so one deployment can carry a different identifier for each customer.

**Datto RMM**

| Field      | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server URL | The platform URL for your Datto instance, including `https://`, for example `https://pinotage.rmm.datto.com`. |

**Syncro RMM**

| Field      | Description                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client URL | Per tenant. The full download URL of the agent installer for that customer's account. |

**Huntress**

| Field            | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account Key      | Your Huntress MSP account key, shared across all tenants in the deployment. |
| Organization Key | Per tenant. The organisation identifier for that customer.                  |

**CW Automate**

| Field                             | Description                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Installer Token                   | Per tenant. A generated agent installer token.                       |
| Location ID                       | Per tenant. The Automate location the agent should register against. |

Installer tokens are generated on the Automate server. This [community script](https://forums.mspgeek.org/files/file/50-generate-agent-installertoken/) covers one way of producing them.

**CW Command**

ConnectWise RMM, previously known as Command and before that Continuum.

| Field      | Description                                                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client URL | Per tenant. The full download URL of the agent installer for that customer's site. |

{% hint style="info" %}
Chocolatey deployments use a [prepared IntuneWin file](https://github.com/CyberDrain/CIPP/blob/dev/backend/AddChocoApp/IntunePackage.intunewin?raw=true) containing `install.ps1` and `uninstall.ps1`, which install Chocolatey and then run the install or uninstall command. You are strongly encouraged to download and inspect this package before using it, and you can substitute your own in a fork if you would rather not rely on it.

**Microsoft Edge**

Deploys Microsoft Edge using Intune's built-in Edge deployment. Nothing is packaged or uploaded; Intune installs it from Microsoft's own source. Edge is a singleton per tenant, so a tenant that already has it is skipped rather than given a second copy.

| Field            | Description                                                                                                              |

| Publisher                                           | The publisher shown in Intune and the Company Portal. Defaults to CIPP when left blank.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Description                                         | Optional text shown in Intune and the Company Portal.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Uninstall Script (PowerShell, Optional)             | The script contents that remove the application, uploaded as `uninstall.ps1`. Leaving this blank means the application has no uninstall action.                                                                                             |
| Use Detection Script instead of file/path detection | Swaps the two path detection fields for a detection script.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Detection Path                                      | The file or folder that indicates the application is installed, for example `C:\Program Files\MyApp`. When left blank, CIPP creates a detection rule looking for a marker file under `%ProgramData%\CIPPApps\` named after the application. |
| Detection File/Folder Name                          | A specific file to look for inside the detection path, for example `app.exe`. When left blank, the last segment of the detection path is treated as the item to detect.                                                                     |
| Detection Script                                    | The script that verifies the application is installed, used when script detection is enabled. Exiting with code 0 and writing to STDOUT counts as detected.                                                                                 |
| Install as System                                   | Runs the scripts under the SYSTEM account rather than as the signed-in user. Enabled by default.                                                                                                                                            |
| Disable Restart                                     | Suppresses any device restart after installation. Enabled by default.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Run as 32-bit on 64-bit system                      | Forces the scripts to run in 32-bit PowerShell. Leave off unless the application requires it.                                                                                                                                               |
| Enforce signature check                             | Requires the scripts to be digitally signed before Intune will run them.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Mark for Uninstallation                             | Deploys the application with an uninstall intent, so it is removed from targeted devices instead of installed.                                                                                                                              |

**Assignment Options**

Every application type except the MSP apps offers the same assignment choices at the bottom of the form.

| Option                          | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Do Not Assign                   | Creates the application in Intune without targeting anyone.                                                                    |
| Assign to All Users             | Targets all licensed users in each selected tenant.                                                                            |
| Assign to All Devices           | Targets all devices in each selected tenant.                                                                                   |
| Assign to All Users and Devices | Targets both of the above.                                                                                                     |
| Assign to Custom Group          | Targets named groups. Enter the group display names separated by commas, where `*` may be used as a wildcard.                  |
| Exclude Group Names             | Shown for every option except Do Not Assign. Excludes the named groups, again comma separated and accepting `*` as a wildcard. |

{% hint style="info" %}
Group names here are matched by display name across every selected tenant, so a wildcard such as `SEC-Workstations*` lets one deployment target similarly named groups in each customer without listing them individually.

## Table Details

The properties returned are for the Graph resource type `mobileApp`. For more information on the properties please see the [Graph documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-apps-mobileapp?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties).

CIPP adds the following columns by resolving each application's assignments against the groups in the tenant:

| Column         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| App Assignment | The targets the application is assigned to, each followed by its assignment intent in brackets. Group assignments show the group's display name, and broad assignments show as All Devices or All Licensed Users. |
| App Exclude    | The groups that are excluded from the application's assignments, each followed by the assignment intent in brackets.                                                                                              |

{% hint style="info" %}
Every assignment action offers an assignment mode. **Append** keeps the existing assignments and adds or overwrites only the targets you selected. **Replace** overwrites existing assignments, and for Assign to Custom Group it replaces only the direction you chose (include or exclude), leaving the other direction and any All Users or All Devices targets intact.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Choosing the Uninstall intent creates an uninstall assignment, which will remove the application from the targeted devices rather than simply unassigning it.
