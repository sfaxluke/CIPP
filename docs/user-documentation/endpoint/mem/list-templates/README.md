# Policy Templates

Lists the Intune policy templates saved in CIPP, which are the templates the **Deploy Policy** button on the policy pages draws from. Templates can be imported from a community repository, captured from an existing tenant, or created by saving a policy from one of the policy list pages. Filter buttons narrow the list to Synced Templates or Custom Templates.

## Action Buttons

<details>

<summary>Browse Catalog</summary>

Opens a drawer for adding templates to CIPP, with two sources to choose between.

**Community Catalog** is the template catalog described in [community-repos](../../../tools/community-repos/ "mention"), narrowed to Intune templates. Templates can be previewed and imported the same way as on that page.

**From a Tenant** captures an existing policy from one of your tenants as a template. Select a tenant, then search its policies by name or description and import the one you want.

## Table Details

| Column       | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display Name | The name of the template.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Is Synced    | Whether the template came from a community repository and is still linked to it. A template that has been edited or cloned is no longer linked and shows as not synced.         |
| Package      | The package the template has been tagged with, where one has been assigned. Packages let a standards template pull in a set of templates by tag rather than by naming each one. |
| Description  | The description recorded against the template.                                                                                                                                  |
| Type         | The template type, for example Catalog, Device, Admin, AppProtection or deviceCompliancePolicies. This determines how the policy is written when deployed.                      |
| Usage        | The standards templates that use this template, and whether each one references it directly or picks it up through its package tag.                                             |

{% hint style="info" %}
Selecting a row opens a flyout listing the standards templates the template is used in, each linking through to that template, followed by the template's own configuration. This is worth checking before deleting a template, since a template in use by a standard will stop that standard applying.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Packages are viewed, renamed and deleted from [template-packages.md](../../../tools/template-packages.md "mention").
{% endhint %}
