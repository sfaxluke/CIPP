{% step %}
### Tenant Selection

Select the tenant you want to bulk create SharePoint sites for. This will auto-select the tenant you have selected in the top menu bar.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Upload CSV

{% hint style="info" %}
Select **Download Example CSV** to get a correctly formatted file to work from. The columns are `siteName`, `siteDescription`, `siteOwner`, `templateName`, `siteDesign`, `sensitivityLabel` and `isPublic`.
{% endhint %}

`templateName` is `Team` (team site without a group), `TeamGroup` (team site with a new Microsoft 365 group) or `Communication`. `siteDesign` (`Blank`, `Showcase` or `Topic`) applies to `Team` and `Communication` only and can be left blank for `TeamGroup`. `isPublic` applies to `TeamGroup` only: `true` creates a public group, blank or `false` a private one.

Upload your CSV file, or select **Add Item** to add a row by hand.

Review the table. If a row is wrong, select **Delete Row** from the actions column and add it again.
{% endstep %}
