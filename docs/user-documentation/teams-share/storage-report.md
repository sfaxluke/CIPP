# Storage Report

The Storage Report shows where a single tenant's storage capacity is being used, across SharePoint sites, Teams-connected sites and OneDrive accounts, and highlights sites that are near quota, inactive, or holding storage that could be reclaimed. Teams storage is not a separate pool: a Teams-connected site is SharePoint capacity on a group or channel site, tracked alongside the rest of SharePoint. File-level M365 Archive usage is added to the report once SharePoint admin access is available and the data has been synced. The report requires a single tenant to be selected; under **AllTenants** the page shows a placeholder asking you to pick a tenant instead.

## Syncing Storage Data

The report reads from cached usage data rather than querying SharePoint and OneDrive live.

| Control   | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sync data | Queues a refresh of SharePoint site usage (including file-level archive metrics, where SharePoint admin access is available) and OneDrive usage for this tenant. Progress is shown next to the button, and the report refreshes itself once the sync finishes. |
| Refresh   | Reloads the report from the cached data without running a new sync.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

{% hint style="info" %}
If no cached data has been synced yet, or one of SharePoint or OneDrive comes back empty, a banner invites you to click **Sync data**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If SharePoint usage figures look empty even after a sync, Microsoft may not have generated a site usage report for the tenant yet. Sync again later, or check the reports in the SharePoint admin center directly.
{% endhint %}

## Anonymised Reports

Microsoft 365 has a tenant-wide setting that conceals user names in usage reports, replacing them with hashes rather than user principal names. Where CIPP detects that this report has come back anonymised, it shows a warning above the results.

The fix is on the tenant, not in CIPP. Enabling the **Enable Usernames instead of pseudo anonymised names in reports** standard turns the setting off, after which the report needs syncing again to pick up real names.

## Tenant Storage

A storage bar above the summary shows how much of the tenant's overall SharePoint storage pool is used, with chips for storage used, storage free and the total quota. On a tenant with more than one geo location, a chip is added for each geo showing its own usage. The bar needs SharePoint admin access; if it can't retrieve a quota figure for the tenant, it reads "Tenant storage usage is unavailable for this tenant" instead.

## Summary

A row of headline counts sits above the charts.

| Indicator                      | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SharePoint Sites                | The number of SharePoint sites that are not connected to Teams.                                                        |
| Teams-Connected                 | The number of SharePoint sites connected to a Team (group or channel sites).                                           |
| OneDrive Accounts               | The number of OneDrive accounts.                                                                                       |
| Near quota (≥80%)               | Sites using 80% or more of their allocated storage.                                                                    |
| Inactive (≥90d)                 | Sites with no recorded activity in the last 90 days, or with no activity date at all.                                  |
| File-level archive (est.)       | Estimated storage held in file-level M365 Archive across all sites. Only shown once archive metrics have been synced. |
| Sites with file archive         | The number of sites that have any file-level archive usage. Shown alongside File-level archive (est.).                |
| Reclaimable (est.)              | Estimated storage a cleanup scan could reclaim across all scanned sites. Only shown after running **Scan cleanup**.    |

A row of chips beneath the summary repeats the near-quota, inactive, Teams-connected, top-site, file-archive and reclaimable highlights; clicking any of them switches to the SharePoint Sites tab.

## Charts

## Filters

Buttons above the SharePoint Sites table apply common filters in one click:

| Filter                    | Shows                                             |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Near quota (≥80%)           | Only sites using 80% or more of their allocated storage. |
| Has cleanup opportunity     | Only sites a cleanup scan has flagged as reclaimable. |
| Has file-level archive      | Only sites with file-level M365 Archive usage.        |
| Teams-connected             | Only sites connected to a Team.                       |
| SharePoint (non-Teams)      | Only sites not connected to a Team.                   |

## Finding Cleanup Opportunities

**Scan cleanup** on the SharePoint Sites table queues a scan of every SharePoint site in the tenant, aside from OneDrive personal sites and a handful of system sites such as the search centre, content type hub and app catalogue. Each site is checked for a large amount of old file versions, a full recycle bin, or a document library that has grown out of proportion to the rest of the site. Progress is shown next to **Cleanup scan** near the top of the page, and the table refreshes itself once the scan finishes.

{% hint style="info" %}
If no cleanup scan has been cached yet, a banner invites you to click **Scan cleanup**.
{% endhint %}

Once a scan has run, sites with an opportunity show a **Cleanup** value and an estimated reclaim amount in the table, and the summary and chip row above pick up a **Reclaimable (est.)** figure. Running **Scan cleanup** (now **Rescan cleanup**) again re-scans every site afresh.

Selecting **Cleanup…** on a site, or on a flagged row from the chip row, opens the storage cleanup drawer for that site:

* A composition breakdown, estimating how the site's storage divides between current files, previous file versions, and the recycle bin.
* A **Versions** tab listing the top libraries by estimated version storage, with a button to start a version cleanup job, and the status of any job already running or completed for the site.
* A **Recycle** tab summarising the first-stage and second-stage recycle bin, with a button to empty it entirely.

{% hint style="info" %}
The composition and version figures are estimates, not exact counts, and carry no file names. Reclaimed storage from a version cleanup job may differ from the estimate until the job itself reports how much was released.
{% endhint %}

Starting a version cleanup job asks for a mode: **Sync Policy** applies the site's own version policy to versions that already exist, **Delete Older Than Days** removes versions older than a set number of days (SharePoint requires at least 30), and **Count Limits** keeps a maximum number of major versions. The **Versions** tab needs SharePoint site write access.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Emptying a recycle bin is permanent and cannot be undone. You choose whether to empty the first stage, the second stage, or both.
{% endhint %}

The **Recycle** tab needs SharePoint site recycle bin read access to view, and recycle bin write access to empty it.

## Table Details

The report is split into two tabs, **SharePoint Sites** and **OneDrive**, each counted in its own tab label.
