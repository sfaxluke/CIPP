# PIM Templates

The **PIM Templates** tab of the Roles & PIM page lists the role settings templates. Besides building one by hand, the **Create template from role settings** action on the Roles & Assignments tab captures a role's current settings from a tenant into a new template; values below the secure floor are raised to the closest allowed value and every raise is reported. A PIM template describes how a set of Entra directory roles must behave in Privileged Identity Management: how long an activation may last, what an administrator has to prove and write down to activate, whether someone has to approve, how long eligible and active assignments may exist, and who is notified. The **PIM Role Settings Template** standard deploys a template to a tenant and reports drift from it.

## The secure floor

Templates are validated when they are saved and again every time the standard runs. A template that falls below CIPP's secure floor is refused with the list of problems; it is never silently adjusted.

| Setting                                   | Floor                                                       | Default  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Maximum activation duration               | Must expire; at most 24 hours. Above 8 hours is allowed but logged as a warning. | 8 hours  |
| Activation requires                       | MFA, or a Conditional Access authentication context         | MFA      |
| Justification on activation               | Always required                                             | Required |
| Maximum eligible assignment duration      | Must expire; at most 1 year                                 | 1 year   |
| Maximum active assignment duration        | Must expire; at most 1 year                                 | 6 months |
| Justification when creating an assignment | Always required                                             | Required |
| Approval, ticket, notifications           | Optional                                                    | Off      |

Requiring active assignments to expire means administrators cannot create permanent active assignments in the Entra portal either once the template is deployed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Approvers are stored as group display names or user principal names and resolved in each tenant when the standard runs, so one template works across tenants. If none of the approvers exist in a tenant the template is not applied there and an error is logged.
