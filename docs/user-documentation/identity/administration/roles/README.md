# Roles & PIM

The Roles & PIM page has two tabs: **Roles & Assignments**, covered here, and [PIM Templates](templates/README.md), the role settings templates the **PIM Role Settings Template** standard deploys.

## Roles & Assignments

One row per directory role, like the classic Roles page, with the Privileged Identity Management (PIM) breakdown on top: how many principals hold the role permanently, as an eligibility or with a time-bound active assignment, and a summary of the role's PIM settings. Clicking a role expands it into its assignments, where the actions live. Roles that nobody holds are listed too, so the table is also the complete role catalogue; hide them with **Assigned roles only** when reviewing access.

On Entra ID P2 tenants the data comes from PIM. On tenants without P2 every assignment is, by definition, permanent and only the legacy removal is offered. With **All Tenants** selected the page reads the reporting cache instead of Graph (roles nobody holds are not included there).

### Table Details

| Column             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Role               | The directory role. The Extended Info flyout adds the role's description, whether it is built in or custom, and its template id.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Members            | How many principals hold the role. Click it for a quick list of who, with each one's assignment type and end date.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Permanent Count    | Principals holding the role actively with no end date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Eligible Count     | Principals who can activate the role through PIM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Active Count       | Principals holding the role actively with an end date - set by an administrator or through a PIM activation.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Is Privileged Role | Whether the role is on CIPP's privileged-roles list (the same list the standards and alerts use).                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Policy Summary     | The role's PIM settings: maximum activation, whether MFA or an authentication context and a justification are required, approval, and whether eligible and active assignments must expire. The Extended Info flyout adds **Policy Below Floor** when these settings fall below CIPP's secure floor. |

### Filters

**Roles with permanent admins**, **Privileged roles only**, **Privileged roles with permanent admins**, **Policy below secure floor**, **Assigned roles only**, **Roles nobody holds** and **Custom roles**.

### Assignments

Clicking a role opens it with its assignments underneath: one row per principal and scope, showing whether it is held permanently, as an eligibility, time-bound, or because an eligible administrator activated the role (**ActivatedFromEligible**), whether it is held directly or through a role-assignable group, the scope (the whole directory or one administrative unit) and the end date. Group-inherited rows cannot be changed here; change the group's own assignment instead.

All actions move access in the secure direction only. CIPP cannot turn an eligibility into a permanent assignment or create a new permanent assignment: every request must carry an end date or a duration, and the request is refused otherwise. Anything touching the Global Administrator role asks you to type the principal's name to confirm. Every change is written to the logbook with the assignment type before and after.

<table><thead><tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th><th data-type="checkbox">Bulk Action Available</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Convert to eligible</td><td>For a permanent assignment. Creates a PIM eligibility with the chosen lifetime, confirms it exists, and only then removes the permanent assignment, so the principal never loses access without gaining eligibility. Refused for service principals (PIM eligibility does not support them), for the last active Global Administrator, and for the CIPP-SAM application.</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Grant time-bound active assignment</td><td>For an eligible principal. Creates an active assignment that Entra removes automatically at the chosen end (a preset duration or a custom end date). The lifetime cannot exceed the role's PIM policy maximum or the JIT admin maximum duration.</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Extend</td><td>Pushes out the end of a time-bound active assignment or an eligibility, counted from now and within the policy maximum.</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Renew</td><td>Renews an expired time-bound assignment or eligibility.</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Remove assignment</td><td>Removes the eligibility or the active assignment. The last active Global Administrator is never removed. On tenants without Entra ID P2 this removes the directory role membership directly.</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Create template from role settings</td><td>On the role row. Builds a <a href="templates/README.md">PIM template</a> from the role's current PIM settings in the tenant. A live policy may sit below the secure floor (Entra's defaults do); a template never stores that, so each offending value is raised to the closest value the floor allows and every raise is listed in the results. Greyed out unless you have role write access, for a role that is not PIM capable, or when CIPP could not read its current policy.</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>More Info</td><td>Opens the role's Extended Info flyout: the role details, the counts and the assignments with these actions.</td><td>false</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
A justification is required for every action. It is recorded on the PIM request in Entra and in the CIPP logbook. End times in the result messages are shown in your browser's time zone; the assignment itself is stored in UTC.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Service principals that hold roles permanently are listed but cannot be converted, because PIM eligibility is only available for users and groups. Review whether the application still needs the role and remove the assignment if it does not.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
This page covers Entra ID directory roles. Permissions granted through Exchange Online role groups, Azure resource roles, or Microsoft Purview are held elsewhere and do not appear here, so a review of who holds administrative access needs to take in those as well.
