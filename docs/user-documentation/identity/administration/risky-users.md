# Risky Users

This page lists the accounts Microsoft Entra ID Protection currently holds a risk assessment for, so a tenant's flagged users can be reviewed and cleared without opening the Entra portal. The table is sorted with the most recently updated risk first.

## Table Actions

<table><thead><tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th><th data-type="checkbox">Bulk Action Available</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dismiss Risk</td><td>Marks the account's risk as dismissed, which tells Entra ID Protection the activity was legitimate and returns the account to a normal state.</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Research Compromised Account</td><td>Opens the Compromise Remediation tab for the account, where the usual indicators of compromise are gathered in one place.</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>More Info</td><td>Opens the Extended Info flyout with the full details for the selected row.</td><td>false</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Dismissing a risk closes it without changing anything about the account. It does not reset a password, revoke a session or remove whatever caused the detection, so an account that really is compromised stays compromised with its warning cleared. Investigate before dismissing, and remediate through the [bec.md](users/user/bec.md "mention") page or the Users list where the account turns out to be at risk.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This page depends on Microsoft Entra ID Protection, which needs Entra ID P2 licensing. Tenants without it return no risk data, so an empty table means the feature is unavailable rather than that no user is at risk.
