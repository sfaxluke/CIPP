# JIT Role Templates

A JIT Role Template is a named allow-list of Entra ID directory roles. Assigning one to a [CIPP custom role](../../../cipp/advanced/authentication/cipp-roles/README.md) restricts members of that role to only grant the roles in the template when creating a JIT Admin, and they can only see existing JIT Admins whose roles fall entirely within the template.

{% hint style="info" %}
Restriction combines the same way CIPP handles multiple custom roles elsewhere - restrictively, not additively. A custom role with no template assigned does not restrict anything on its own, but as soon as a user holds a role that has a template they are restricted, and their allowed roles are the intersection of every template they hold. An untemplated role cannot be used to bypass a template assigned alongside it. Admin and Super Admin users are unaffected, and if no template is assigned anywhere nothing changes, so existing configurations are not disturbed until you assign one.
