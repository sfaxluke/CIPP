# User Preferences

The Preferences page holds the interface settings that control how CIPP looks and behaves for you, along with defaults used elsewhere in the application. Most settings on this page can be saved either for your own account or for all users of the instance, chosen from the Actions card before saving. Where a setting is saved for all users, an individual user's own preference takes precedence over it.

The page opens on whichever scope currently applies to you: your own settings if you have saved any, and the all-users settings if you have not.

## General Settings

| Setting                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Default Page Size                         | How many rows tables show per page by default, chosen from 25, 50, 100, or 250. Required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Table view on small screens               | How tables present themselves when the window is narrow: **Automatic (cards on mobile)** shows a card list below roughly 900px and the classic table above it, **Always card list** shows cards at every width, and **Always classic table** keeps the table at every width. See [mobile-layout.md](../mobile-layout.md "mention").                                                                             |
| Default test suite on the Home page       | The test suite whose results are shown on the Home page by default, chosen from your saved test reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Added Attributes when creating a new user | Additional user attributes to make available on the new user form. Anything selected here appears as an extra field when creating a user. The available attributes are `consentProvidedForMinor`, `employeeId`, `employeeHireDate`, `employeeLeaveDateTime`, `employeeType`, `faxNumber`, `legalAgeGroupClassification`, `officeLocation`, `otherMails`, `showInAddressList`, and `sponsor`. |
| Save last used table filter               | When enabled, the filter you last applied to a table is remembered and re-applied the next time you open it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Default Page Size** sets the starting value only. An individual table's own rows-per-page control offers 500 as well, and choosing it there applies for as long as you stay on that page.
{% endhint %}

## Navigation Settings

| Setting                | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Show Sidebar Bookmarks | Shows your bookmarked pages in the sidebar.                           |
| Show Popover Bookmarks | Shows your bookmarked pages in a popover opened from the menu bar.    |
| Bookmark Reorder Mode  | How bookmarks are reordered: with Arrow Buttons, or by Drag and Drop. |
| Compact Navigation     | Reduces the size of the navigation menu so more of it fits on screen. |

## Offboarding Default Settings

Sets which offboarding options are pre-selected when you offboard a user, so that routine offboardings do not have to be configured each time. These are defaults only and can still be changed for an individual offboarding.

A label on the card indicates which defaults are currently in effect: **Using Tenant Defaults**, **Using User Defaults**, **Using All Users Defaults**, or **Using Default Settings** where none have been saved.

| Setting                                       | Description                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Remove from all groups                        | Removes the user from every group they belong to.                      |
| Hide from Global Address List                 | Hides the user's mailbox from the address list.                        |
| Remove Licenses                               | Removes all licences assigned to the user.                             |
| Cancel all calendar invites                   | Cancels the meetings the user has organised.                           |
| Revoke all sessions                           | Signs the user out of all active sessions.                             |
| Remove users mailbox permissions              | Removes the permissions the user holds on other mailboxes.             |
| Remove users calendar permissions             | Removes the permissions the user holds on other calendars.             |
| Remove all Rules                              | Removes the inbox rules on the user's mailbox.                         |
| Reset Password                                | Resets the user's password.                                            |
| Keep copy of forwarded mail in source mailbox | Where mail is being forwarded, retains a copy in the original mailbox. |
| Delete User                                   | Deletes the user account.                                              |
| Wipe Mobile Devices (account data only)       | Wipes the Exchange account data from the user's registered mobile devices, without removing the devices themselves. |
| Remove all Mobile Devices                     | Removes the user's registered mobile devices.                          |
| Disable Sign in                               | Blocks the user from signing in.                                       |
| Remove all MFA Devices                        | Removes the user's registered multi-factor authentication methods.     |
| Remove Teams Phone DID                        | Removes the phone number assigned to the user in Teams.                |
| Clear Immutable ID                            | Clears the user's immutable ID.                                        |
| Disable OneDrive Sharing Links                | Disables the sharing links the user created in OneDrive.               |
| Out of Office Message                         | Default automatic reply for offboardings. Leave blank to not set. Supports CIPP `%variable%` tokens (for example `%tenantname%` and tenant custom variables), which are resolved when the offboarding job runs. `%username%` is not the offboarded user. |

An Out of Office message alone is enough for these defaults to count as configured for the user vs all-users precedence.

A **Send results to** section chooses where the outcome of an offboarding is reported, with options for Webhook, E-mail, and PSA.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a tenant has its own offboarding defaults saved, those replace your personal defaults entirely for that tenant — including when the tenant message field is empty.
{% endhint %}

## Portal Links Configuration

Chooses which Microsoft portal shortcuts appear in the tenant information flyout. All are enabled by default; switch off any you do not use to shorten the list.

The available portals are M365, Exchange, Entra, Teams, Azure, Intune, SharePoint, Security, Purview, Power Platform, and Power BI. The **Manage Tenant** entry is always shown and cannot be switched off. See [tenant-select.md](tenant-select.md "mention").

## Developer Options

Diagnostic options intended for troubleshooting and development.

| Option               | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TanStack Query Tools | Enables or disables the query developer tools, used for inspecting how data is fetched and cached.                                                  |
| Advanced Views       | Enables or disables advanced views, which reveal diagnostic pages that are otherwise hidden from day-to-day use, such as audit-log Search Coverage. |

{% hint style="info" %}
These two take effect the moment you click them, and are not part of what the **Save Changes** button commits. They are stored in the browser you are using, so they apply only to you on this device and cannot be set for all users.
{% endhint %}

## CIPP Roles

A read-only card lists the CIPP roles held by the account you are signed in as, so you can confirm what your access allows. Roles cannot be changed here.

## Saving Your Preferences

The Actions card controls who your changes apply to and commits them.

| Control       | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User selector | Chooses whether the settings are saved for Current User or for All Users. Selecting a different option reloads the page's values to show the settings that apply to that scope. |
| Save Changes  | Saves the settings for the selected scope. The button is unavailable while any required field is empty or invalid, and a message confirms the save or reports an error.         |
