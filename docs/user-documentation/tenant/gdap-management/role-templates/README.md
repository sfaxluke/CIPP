# Role Templates

This page lists the GDAP role templates you have created. A template is a named set of admin roles, and it is what you select when generating an invite or onboarding a tenant, so every relationship is built with a consistent set of permissions.

Each role in a template is backed by a security group in your partner tenant. CIPP creates those groups for you as you build the template, so this page is the only one you normally need: add your technicians to the groups and they gain the matching delegated access in your customer tenants.

If you have no templates yet, the page offers to create the **CIPP Defaults** template, which contains the 15 roles listed on the [recommended-roles.md](../../../../setup/maintaining-cipp/recommended-roles.md "mention") page, or to build a custom one. If you have templates but none named `CIPP Defaults`, a warning offers to create it - so the prompt returns if you delete or rename that template.

Use **Add Template** to create a template via [add.md](add.md "mention"), or **Group Mappings** to review the underlying role-to-group mappings on [mappings.md](mappings.md "mention").
