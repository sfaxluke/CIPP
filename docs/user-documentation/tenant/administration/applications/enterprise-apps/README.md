# Enterprise Applications

Enterprise applications are the service principals present in the selected tenant: every application that has been granted a presence there, including Microsoft first-party services, third-party SaaS apps that users or admins have consented to, and any partner applications such as CIPP's own SAM app. Listing them is the quickest way to audit what has access to a tenant, spot applications carrying client secrets or certificates, and identify leftover integrations from a previous provider.

The table is read live from Microsoft Graph each time the page loads, so it always reflects the tenant's current state.

{% hint style="info" %}
Microsoft first-party service principals make up the bulk of a typical tenant's list. Sort or filter on **Publisher Name** to bring third-party and partner applications to the top.
{% endhint %}

## Page Actions

**Deploy Template** opens [appapproval.md](../../../../tools/tenant-tools/appapproval.md "mention"), where a saved application template can be deployed to one or more tenants.

## Table Details

The properties returned are for the Graph resource type `servicePrincipal`. For more information on the properties please see the [Graph documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties).

The password and certificate credential columns are included so that applications holding secrets or certificates, and their expiry dates, can be reviewed without opening each application in turn.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Removing credentials, disabling, or deleting a service principal takes effect immediately and will break any integration currently authenticating as that application. Confirm what an application is used for before acting on it, particularly for applications published by your own or another partner organisation.
