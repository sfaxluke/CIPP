# Global Variables

Global variables are key-value pairs that can be used to store additional information for All Tenants. These are applied to templates in standards using the format %variablename%. If a tenant has a custom variable with the same name, the tenant's variable will take precedence.

These variables can be used in any type of template and will be replaced automatically.

Tenant custom variables can be set in the [#custom-variables](../../manage/edit.md#custom-variables "mention") box, shown while editing a Tenant.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Given the differences in how various systems treat the variable name, we recommend using all lowercase when naming variables, for example variablename.
{% endhint %}

## Automatically Replaced Variables

The following variables will be automatically replaced by CIPP:

* `%initialdomain%`
* `%tenantfilter%`
* `%tenantid%`
* `%tenantname%`

## Reserved Variables

The following variables are reserved and will not be used:

* `%cippurl%`
* `%cippuserschema%`
* `%defaultdomain%`
* `%partnertenantid%`
* `%programdata%`
* `%programfiles%`
* `%programfiles(x86)%`
* `%samappid%`
* `%serial%`
* `%systemdrive%`
* `%systemroot%`
* `%temp%`
* `%userdomain%`
* `%username%`
* `%userprofile%`
* `%windir%`

## Unresolved Variables

CIPP replaces only the variables that exist for the tenant being processed, which is the global set combined with that tenant's own variables. A variable that has neither a global value nor a tenant value is not resolved, and nothing blocks or validates the template beforehand. The token is left in place as the literal text `%variablename%` and is sent to Microsoft Graph exactly as written.

Graph rejects the malformed value, so the standard fails for that tenant and the failure is recorded in the Standards logs for that tenant only. Tenants that do have a value for the variable continue to deploy normally, which is why this typically shows up as a template that works everywhere except for a handful of tenants. When you see an unexpected Graph error on a Standards deployment, check that every tenant in scope has a value for each variable the template uses.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Always give a variable a global value when it is used in a template deployed through Standards, even if you intend every tenant to override it. The global value acts as a fallback, so a tenant that has not been given its own value still deploys a valid value instead of failing. Choose a global default that is safe to apply to any tenant, because it is used wherever a tenant-specific value is missing.
{% endhint %}

The reserved variables listed above behave differently: they are deliberately passed through untouched so the target system can resolve them, and they are not a sign of a missing value.
