# Mailboxes

This page lists the Exchange Online mailboxes in the selected tenant and is the starting point for mailbox administration. Alongside creating shared mailboxes, it carries the per-mailbox actions that would otherwise need Exchange Online PowerShell: permissions, archives, holds, quotas, conversions and calendar processing.

## Action Buttons

<details>

<summary>Add Shared Mailbox</summary>

Creates a shared mailbox in the selected tenant.

| Field        | Description                                                                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display Name | The name shown in the address list. Required.                                            |
| Username     | The part before the @ symbol. Required.                                                  |
| Domain       | The domain used after the @ symbol, chosen from the tenant's verified domains. Required. |

**Create Shared Mailbox** submits the form. Once a mailbox has been created the button changes to **Create Another Mailbox** and the form clears, keeping the domain you chose so several mailboxes can be created in succession.

## Table Details

| Column                     | Description                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display Name               | The name shown throughout Microsoft 365 and in the address list.                                        |
| Recipient Type Details     | The kind of mailbox: `UserMailbox`, `SharedMailbox`, `RoomMailbox`, `EquipmentMailbox` and so on.       |
| UPN                        | The user principal name of the account the mailbox belongs to.                                          |
| Primary Smtp Address       | The address mail is sent from and delivered to by default.                                              |
| Additional Email Addresses | Every secondary SMTP address on the mailbox, comma separated. The primary address is not repeated here. |
| Storage Used In Bytes      | How much of the mailbox is in use, taken from Microsoft 365 usage reporting for the last seven days.    |
| Archive Enabled            | Whether an online archive exists for the mailbox.                                                       |
| Archive Size               | How much of the online archive is in use. Zero for a mailbox with no archive.                           |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Storage Used In Bytes** and **Archive Size** come from usage reporting rather than from the mailbox itself, so they are only present when the table is reading cached data.
{% endhint %}

The row flyout and the page filters expose further properties, most usefully **Auto Expanding Archive** and **Auto Expanding Archive Scope**. Auto-expanding archiving can be switched on for the whole organisation or for a single mailbox, and the organisation setting wins, so the scope tells you which of the two is responsible: `Organization`, `Mailbox`, or `None` when it is off.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If every mailbox reports zero storage used, an alert appears above the table. This almost always means Microsoft 365 report anonymisation is switched on for the tenant, which replaces the user principal names in usage reports with pseudonyms and stops CIPP matching the usage data back to the mailboxes. Enabling the **Enable Usernames instead of pseudo anonymised names in reports** standard turns the setting off, after which the data needs syncing again to restore the figures.
{% endhint %}
