# Mail Flow Statistics

This page charts the selected tenant's mail flow over the last 7, 14, 30 or 90 days: how much mail arrived, how much of it was good, and how much Exchange Online stopped as spam, phishing or malware. A stacked bar chart breaks the dispositions down by day, a donut splits traffic by direction (inbound, outbound and intra-org), and two tables list the top mail senders and the top spam recipients.

## Action Buttons

<details>

<summary>Export Report</summary>

Generates a branded, client-ready PDF of the currently selected date range: an executive summary with a computed mail hygiene rating, the daily volume and disposition figures, the top senders and top spam recipients, and a set of recommendations drawn from that window's own data. A preview opens first, with a **Download PDF** button alongside it. Greyed out while the figures are loading, or when the tenant has no mail flow data for the selected period.

## Where the numbers come from

The daily disposition counts come from the Exchange Online `Get-MailFlowStatusReport` cmdlet, and the top sender and top spam recipient tables from `Get-MailTrafficSummaryReport`. Both support at most 90 days of history, which is why the period selector stops there.
