# Tenants

The Tenants page lists every tenant CIPP knows about and controls how CIPP connects to each one. From here you can exclude tenants from processing, refresh or reset the permissions CIPP holds in a tenant, re-authenticate a direct tenant whose credentials have lapsed, refresh cached data, and remove a tenant altogether. Tenants are reached either through a Partner Center GDAP relationship or added directly with their own service account, and the actions available on a row depend on which of the two applies.

Quick filters above the table narrow the list to Included tenants, Excluded tenants, Direct tenants, or GDAP tenants. Selecting a row opens a flyout with further detail, including, for a direct tenant, the service account CIPP authenticates as and when it last authenticated.

## Table Actions

Several actions apply only to one kind of tenant, and none of them apply to your own partner tenant.

## Force Refresh

The **Force Refresh** button above the table re-reads tenant details and updates the list. Enter a default domain name or tenant ID to refresh a single tenant, or leave the field empty to refresh them all. This is also the way to make a tenant that is missing from the list reappear.
