# Sponsor Quick Start

{% hint style="success" %}
If you need assistance with or aren't comfortable navigating these requirements alone, take a look at our [Professional Onboarding Services](../../setup/resources/professional-onboarding-services.md) page, which offers a paid option for those who need a bit more hands on guidance with GDAP & CIPP deployment.
{% endhint %}

If you've started the sponsorship process and are ready to enhance your management of Microsoft 365 tenants with efficiency, this guide is designed to get you started.

## **Initial Sponsorship Actions**

1. **Subscription Activation**: Start by signing up for the €99/month subscription through our [secure checkout](https://pay.cyberdrain.com/b/4gM7sLa003Sldjn6nu6wE01).
2. **Welcome Email**: Upon subscription, you will receive an email with detailed instructions to kickstart your deployment. This email will guide you to the [CIPP management portal ](https://management.cipp.app)for deployment steps.

## Deployment & Service Account Creation

3. **Configure CIPP Deployment:** Log in to your [management portal](https://management.cipp.app) using the email address you signed up with if you subscribed through Stripe, or your GitHub account if you are still using GitHub Sponsors before October 1. This is where you can kick off your deployment, add custom domain names, and begin inviting users into CIPP. <mark style="color:yellow;">NOTE: If you are still using GitHub Sponsors and signed up with an organisation account, please send a message to helpdesk@cyberdrain.com with your personal GitHub username so we can help you access the portal. If you have any other trouble accessing the management portal after subscribing, please contact helpdesk@cyberdrain.com.</mark>
4. **Service Account Creation**: Follow the instructions carefully on the [creating-the-cipp-service-account-gdap-ready.md](../../setup/installation/creating-the-cipp-service-account-gdap-ready.md "mention") page to ensure there are no permission issues when connecting your tenants within CIPP in the subsequent steps.

## Accessing CIPP & Executing Setup Wizard

5. **Add Yourself to CIPP:** On the [User Management](https://management.cipp.app/invite-users) page in your management portal, ensure you've invited your work account as an `admin` into your newly deployed instance to avoid `403 Forbidden` errors during login. Further guidance can be found on the [roles.md](../../setup/setting-up-cipp/roles.md "mention") page.
6. **Execute Setup Wizard:** Follow the instructions on the [Executing the Setup Wizard](../../setup/installation/executing-the-setup-wizard.md) page once logged into your CIPP instance using your newly invited account, **NOT** the service account. The service account is only used during specific configuration steps within the Setup Wizard.

## **Managing Client Relationships**

7. **Onboard Existing Relationships:** If your GDAP relationships with clients are already configured and you do not need to create new invites, proceed to [recommended-first-steps.md](../../setup/implementation-guide/recommended-first-steps.md "mention") to start managing your clients immediately.
8. **Establish New Relationships:** If you need to establish new GDAP relationships for new clients, use the [gdap-invite-wizard.md](../../setup/installation/gdap-invite-wizard.md "mention") wizard to generate invites and complete the necessary actions to onboard the client to CIPP.

If you are unsure about whether your clients' environments are GDAP ready, or need more information about the process, continue to the [gdap-invite-wizard.md](../../setup/installation/gdap-invite-wizard.md "mention") page for more granular details & next steps.
