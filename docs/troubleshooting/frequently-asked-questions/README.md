<summary>I updated, but CIPP still says I am out of date. How do I fix this?</summary>

Use a superadmin admin account browse to CIPP -> Advanced -> Container Management -> Status & Updates to arrange auto-update settings.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is hosted CIPP faster?</summary>

Yes. Hosted CIPP is maintained by an expert team of Azure Administrators and runs using different infrastructure than self-hosted CIPP. Hosted CIPP is about 100% faster than self-hosted thanks to ongoing maintenance and better specifications used thanks to scale.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How much does CIPP cost to run?</summary>

Assuming you're running on the click-to-deploy configuration and average usage patterns CIPP has a cost of about €25 a month. You can check the costs, and estimated costs, for the resource group on the Azure Portal.

Hosted CIPP is €99/month and comes with unlimited support, weekly live training sessions, and more benefits.

<summary>Why is my GitHub Sponsors charge annual when I expected it monthly?</summary>

GitHub Sponsors has no billing cycle of its own. A sponsorship takes the billing date, payment method and receipt already set on the GitHub account that started it, so the frequency follows that account's existing plan rather than anything chosen during sponsorship.

If the GitHub account is on annual billing, the sponsorship is billed annually on the same renewal date and lands on the same receipt as the account's other GitHub charges. If the account is on monthly billing, the sponsorship is billed monthly.

Review your account's billing date and payment method at [github.com/settings/billing](https://github.com/settings/billing). Changing the account's billing frequency changes how the sponsorship is billed from the next renewal onwards. See [sponsor-quick-start.md](../../setup/resources/sponsor-quick-start.md "mention") for the rest of the sponsorship process.

<summary>How do we get new integrations?</summary>

We know, you love CIPP. You want everything to integrate with CIPP. Unfortunately, CIPP's business model doesn't allow us to take on the development, documentation, and help desk training to support every integration out there. In order for a vendor to integrate with CIPP, we need them to sponsor CIPP at the integration level.

Vendor sponsorship pays for that development, training, and support. If you have a vendor that you want to see integrated with CIPP, please reach out to your Account Manager at the vendor and let them know that you are interested.

Here's a couple of options for emails that you can send to vendors. Modify these as you see fit for other vendors.

#### Email 1: You love CIPP and would switch vendors based on who we integrate with:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
Hi,

I hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out to you today as I'm a user of a tool called [CIPP](https://cipp.app). It has greatly enhanced my Microsoft 365 experience and is now our core tool when it comes to performing M365 management.

We understand you might be having discussions with their team already, but we just want to amplify that our choice of vendor is dependent on which one integrates with CIPP. Can you let us know if you have any plans to do so? 

Regards,
```
{% endcode %}

#### Email 2: You love CIPP and would like your vendor to integrate

{% code overflow="wrap" %}

<summary>Can I add Conditional Access to my CIPP App?</summary>

To add Conditional Access to CIPP, follow the below steps:

1. Go to your [Conditional Access Policies](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ConditionalAccessBlade/Policies)
2. Select which users to apply the policy to, default suggestion is _"All Users"_
3. Select **CIPP-SSO** as the included app under "Cloud Apps or actions"
4. Configure any condition you want. For example, Trusted Locations, specific IPs, specific platforms.
5. At Access Controls you must enable _Grant, with MFA access_.
6. Select **Save**

Your app is now protected with Conditional Access.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I renamed a tenant. How do I get this to show up in CIPP?</summary>

Beginning with v7, CIPP relies on the tenant's name at the time a GDAP relationship was created. Much of the tenant naming and renaming API capabilities were deprecated. As such, it will no longer pull in live information if you rename a tenant through your Microsoft Partner Portal.

To have the new tenant's name show up in CIPP, you have two options

#### Establish a New Relationship

1. After renaming the tenant, create a new GDAP relationship. You can use the [gdap-invite-wizard.md](../../setup/installation/gdap-invite-wizard.md "mention") wizard to expedite this process.
2. Terminate the old GDAP relationship. This can be accomplished by locating the old relationship on the GDAP [relationships](../../user-documentation/tenant/gdap-management/relationships/ "mention") page and selecting terminate relationship from the per-row actions or Bulk Actions with the row selected.
3. Clear your tenant cache from [settings](../../user-documentation/cipp/settings/ "mention").

#### Utilise the Tenant Alias Functionality

CIPP can also set an alias via the [#properties](../../user-documentation/tenant/manage/edit.md#properties "mention") section of [edit.md](../../user-documentation/tenant/manage/edit.md "mention").

</details>

<details>

<summary>I remediated an admin with no MFA, why is it still alerting?</summary>

The CIPP alert "Alert on admins without any form of MFA" is based on checking a report created by Microsoft. This report is only updated once every 7 days. As such, CIPP recommends only running this alert every 7 days. It's possible the user may still show up on the report after remediation if the report has not refreshed since you completed your remediation steps.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I'm getting an error that "you must use multi-factor authentication to access" what's going on?</summary>

Typically, this error means you're using tokens that don't have a "strong auth claim" or similar. This could be because you're using non-Entra ID MFA or you didn't complete MFA when creating your tokens for one or more of the authentication steps. Make sure you're using a supported MFA method and that you've completed the MFA steps when creating your tokens.

Check the [#multi-factor-authentication-troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md#multi-factor-authentication-troubleshooting "mention") details in the Troubleshooting section for more information.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What if I get errors during management my tenants in CIPP?</summary>

1. **Perform a CPV Permissions Refresh:**
   1. Navigate to Settings -> CIPP -> Application Settings
   2. Click on the Tenants tab.
   3. Click the blue refresh button in the "Actions" column for the relevant tenant.
2. **Perform Permissions Check:**
   1. Navigate to Settings -> CIPP -> Application Settings
   2. Select "Perform Permissions Check"
3. **Conduct GDAP Check**
   1. Navigate to CIPP -> Application Settings -> GDAP Check.
   2. After the Permissions Check, perform the GDAP check
4. **Perform an Access Check:**
   1. Navigate to CIPP -> Application Settings -> Access Check.
   2. Select the relevant tenant and click "Run access check".

Complete all checks for effective troubleshooting. If you still have issues or for detailed instructions, refer to the[refreshing-a-specific-tenants-permissions-via-cpv-api.md](../troubleshooting-instructions/refreshing-a-specific-tenants-permissions-via-cpv-api.md "mention") page, the [troubleshooting-instructions](../troubleshooting-instructions/ "mention") page, and the relevant sections on our [troubleshooting.md](../troubleshooting.md "mention") page.

<summary>I'm getting missing permissions errors when performing the Permissions Check on my CIPP-SAM application. How can I fix this?</summary>

Sometimes when you are running a permissions check, you may encounter specific errors that you are missing some of the API permissions required for CIPP to perform as expected.

To ensure full functionality of CIPP, follow these steps to add the necessary API permissions:

1. Click the `Details` button on the [#permissions-check](../../user-documentation/cipp/settings/permissions.md#permissions-check "mention") section of CIPP Settings > [permissions.md](../../user-documentation/cipp/settings/permissions.md "mention")
2. Click `Repair Permissions`. CIPP will automatically add newly added or missing permissions to your CIPP-SAM application.
3. CIPP will queue up CPV refreshes to push the update permissions to your client tenants.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I resolve expired / revoked auth token errors or ensure the correct service account is used by CIPP?</summary>

This error occurs because the user who authorised the CSP or Graph API connection has had their password changed, sessions revoked, or account disabled. Reauthorisation is required.

**To resolve this, execute the Setup Wizard with Option 4:**

* Go to CIPP → Application Settings → [sam-setup-wizard.md](../../user-documentation/cipp/sam-setup-wizard.md "mention").
* Select "Refresh Tokens for existing application registration"

Occasionally this can happen if there is not a new application secret available to CIPP and the existing one is expired/revoked. In that case, you will first need to:

* Log into Entra on the partner tenant
* Find your CIPP-SAM application in the app registrations
* Add a new client secret
* Choose option "Manually enter credentials" in the Setup Wizard.
* Enter the new app secret only and Submit

**Important:** Ensure your browser allows cookies, disable any ad-blockers, and do not use in-private mode.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I resolve issues with the wrong CIPP-SAM user / Service Account?</summary>

1. **Perform a Permissions Check:**
   * Go to CIPP -> Settings -> [permissions.md](../../user-documentation/cipp/settings/permissions.md "mention")
   * A Permissions Check will automatically run on page load
2. Confirm the UserPrincipalName matches the expected service account.
3. If not, go to the [sam-setup-wizard.md](../../user-documentation/cipp/sam-setup-wizard.md "mention") and select the option to "Refresh Tokens for existing application registration.
4. Review the remaining [#permissions-check](../../user-documentation/cipp/settings/permissions.md#permissions-check "mention") output after replacing the incorrect account.
   * The refresh token matches key vault. This may take a little while to update after first changing the account due to caching.
   * The user should be a service account.
   * The user needs to be a member of the AdminAgents group.
   * The application has all the required permissions. If you have an error here, click the "Details" button and use the built-in permissions repair tool.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I troubleshoot GDAP relationship issues in the partner portal?</summary>

If there are issues with the GDAP relationship, follow these steps:

1. **Check GDAP Relationships:**
   * Go to [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/commerce2/granularadminaccess/list).
   * Select the client you are testing with and look at the relationships.
2. **Verify Access:**
   * If you only see a relationship with "MLT\_", you do not have write-access to the tenant.
   * If you see other relationships, click into them and check if the roles are mapped to groups.
3. **Create Role Mapping:**
   * If roles are not mapped, create the mapping by clicking the + icon.
   * Assign these groups to the CIPP service account.
4. **Identify the CIPP Service Account:**
   * Go to CIPP -> Application Settings -> [permissions.md](../../user-documentation/cipp/settings/permissions.md "mention") -> [#permissions-check](../../user-documentation/cipp/settings/permissions.md#permissions-check "mention").
   * Review the results for the UserPrincipalName to identify the CIPP service account.

<summary>I want to access the portals from my own account</summary>

if you want to use the ability to jump into portals using your own account, add the user that must do this to the M365 GDAP groups generated by CIPP. This allows their accounts permission to all tenants onboarded with GDAP.

</details>

<details>

<summary>My technicians get "no access", blank/half-loading portals, or repeated sign-in prompts when using the Portals links. What's wrong?</summary>

This is one of the most common points of confusion for newly onboarded partners, and it almost always comes down to a single cause: **the technician's own account does not have GDAP access to the client tenant.**

It's important to understand that there are **two different identities** at play in CIPP:

* **The CIPP service account (CIPP-SAM).** This is what CIPP itself uses to read and manage tenants in the background. The onboarding wizard, the 15 [recommended-roles.md](../../setup/maintaining-cipp/recommended-roles.md "mention"), CPV refreshes, and the Permissions Check all relate to _this_ account. If CIPP is displaying tenant data, this account is working.
* **Your individual technician's account.** The **Portals Quick Access** links on the [dashboard](../../user-documentation/dashboard/ "mention") and the portal jump-ins on [tenant-select.md](../../user-documentation/shared-features/menu-bar/tenant-select.md "mention") leave CIPP entirely and open the Microsoft portal **as the signed-in technician** — not as the service account. For these to work, the technician's _own_ account must have a GDAP path into that tenant.

So if CIPP works but a technician can't use the portal links, refreshing CPV, re-running the Permissions Check, or confirming the 15 roles **will not help** — those only affect the service account.

**Typical symptoms, all from the same cause:**

| Symptom                                                                                              | What's happening                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "No SharePoint admin access"                                                                         | The technician's account isn't in the GDAP group mapped to the SharePoint Administrator role.                             |
| M365 portal is blank / Entra portal never finishes loading (or loads the centre but no left sidebar) | The portal opened under the technician's account, which has no delegated role in that tenant, so it can't render.         |
| Prompted to authenticate every time a portal is opened, even with other portal tabs already open     | The technician's account has no standing delegated access to the tenant, so each portal forces a fresh delegated sign-in. |

**The fix:** add the technician's account to the **M365 GDAP** security groups that CIPP generated in your partner tenant. Membership in these groups is what grants a user delegated access through your GDAP relationships.

1. In your **partner tenant**, go to Entra (or the Microsoft 365 admin center) and locate the security groups named `M365 GDAP ...`.
2. Add the technician's user account as a member of the relevant groups (add them to all of the role groups to mirror the access the service account has).
3. Optionally you can nest groups under those roles such that you add staff to a group called `GDAP Technician Accounts` and add that group as a member of the `M365 GDAP ...` groups and then add the staff just to `GDAP Technician Accounts`, when new permissions are added just add the `GDAP Technician Accounts` group to the new `M365 GDAP ...` group and all staff in `GDAP Technician Accounts` will get the new permission
4. Have the technician sign out of the Microsoft portals fully and sign back in so their token picks up the new group membership.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Adding a user to the M365 GDAP groups grants that user delegated access to **every** tenant onboarded with GDAP, not just one client. Only add accounts that should be able to administer all of your clients.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
GDAP delegated access is also bounded by the roles in each relationship. If a role (for example SharePoint Administrator) was never part of the relationship for that client, no one — service account or technician — will have that access until a new relationship containing the role is established. See [recommended-roles.md](../../setup/maintaining-cipp/recommended-roles.md "mention") and the [gdap-management](../../user-documentation/tenant/gdap-management/ "mention") section. [Microsoft GDAP Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/customers/gdap-introduction)

<summary>Applying New Standards to a Tenant</summary>

**Q: How long does it typically take for new standards to be applied to a tenant?**

**A:** It usually takes between 0 to 3 hours for new standards to be applied to a tenant. This timeframe depends on the scheduling of a cron job that automatically initiates the application of standards.

**Q: Can I apply standards immediately instead of waiting for the cron job?**

**A:** Yes, you can apply standards immediately by clicking the "Run Now" buttons located in the top right corner of the interface. This action bypasses the scheduled cron job and applies the standards right away.

</details>

<details>

<summary>When trying to onboard a GDAP relationship, I received an error that only x amount of groups were found, or that the group is not assigned to a user. What does this mean?</summary>

This error can mean two things;

* You migrated using different tools, such as Microsoft Lighthouse.
* You didn't assign the groups to the user after migrating.

Make sure you assign the correct groups to the CIPP service account. For more information see our best practices in [recommended-roles.md](../../setup/maintaining-cipp/recommended-roles.md "mention").

</details>

<details>

<summary>I've already set up my GDAP relationships and given them access to a Global Administrator role. Can I still auto-extend these after their expiration?</summary>

Auto Extend is only available for relationships without the Global Administrator role. If your relationship contains the Global Administrator role you cannot enable this feature. This means that you will need to renew the relationship by reinviting the tenant every 2 years. If your relationships contain at least the [recommended-roles.md](../../setup/maintaining-cipp/recommended-roles.md "mention") in addition to Global Administrator, you can go to [gdap-management](../../user-documentation/tenant/gdap-management/ "mention") -> [relationships](../../user-documentation/tenant/gdap-management/relationships/ "mention"), select one or more relationship and choose the action "Remove Global Administrator from Relationship". After waiting for changes to sync, you can then select the action "Enable automatic extension".

</details>

<details>

<summary>My GitHub personal access token expired and I'm not sure what to do?</summary>

You don't need to do anything. The personal access token was only needed for initial deployment.

</details>
